                        <div class="list-content"><span style="color:#333">David Warner had one of the most memorable
                                debuts in international cricket, when he was plucked from obscurity - without having
                                played a single First-Class match - and made a stunning 89 off 43 balls in a T20l
                                against South Africa. The innings was all the more remarkable due to its timing, coming
                                as it did after a morale-shattering home Test series loss for Australia in 2008-09.
                                <br><br> With T20 success, he made his ODI debut against the South Africans in Hobart.
                                An aggressive 69 in just his second ODI seemed to confirm the rare talent of Warner.
                                However, as the ODIs progressed, his form dipped and he was axed before forcing his way
                                back into the side. He continued to impress in the T20 format of the game, and was one
                                of the few bright spots during Australia's first round exit in the 2009 edition of the
                                T20 WC in England. <br><br> With a slot opening up in the Australian Test squad, Warner
                                was one among the many choices. Already a regular in the ODI line-up, Warner made his
                                Test debut against New Zealand in the Australian summer of 2011. After a modest debut at
                                the Gabba, Warner came into his own with a career-defining century in Hobart. He belied
                                expectations and became the 13th Australian opener to carry his bat through an innings.
                                If the knock in Hobart was full of grit and determination, he showed another side of his
                                batting abilities when he blasted a listless Indian bowling attack to all parts of the
                                WACA during a stunning career-best knock of 180. <br><br>        A Cricket Australia interrogation soon followed, leading to Warner
                                being slapped with a one-year ban. The subsequent fallout included him losing out on his
                                lucrative IPL deal and brand contracts. It was a tough one year for Warner but he seems
                                to have returned a stronger and hungrier man, as evident from his mind-boggling run in
                                the 2019 IPL. It was a no-brainer for Australia to welcome him back to their squads and
                                Warner continues to be a gun batsman for Australia, more so in the shorter formats.
                                <br><br> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br><br> Overseas players are a prized asset to
                                any franchise in the IPL, or any league for that matter. That David Warner has been the
                                most successful overseas batsman in the history of the IPL is saying something. He has
                                scored over 4000 runs over the years in the IPL, with 35 half-centuries and 3 hundreds
                                at a strike-rate in the low 140s and an impressive average of 40.55. Warner has been a
                                key player at the top of the order for the franchises he has represented - Delhi
                                Daredevils from 2009 to 2013, and the Sunrisers Hyderabad since 2014. Warner had an
                                average first season with the Daredevils, scoring at an average of 23, and a relatively
                                low strike rate in the 120s. <br><br> The switch to the Sunrisers worked wonders for the
                                southpaw, after he was contracted by the franchise for US$880,000. In 2015, Warner was
                                given the leadership role for SRH. He failed to take his side through to the playoffs,
                                but he won himself the orange cap in the 2015 season for scoring the most number of runs
                                (562). In the following season, he went a step further, leading his side to their maiden
                                title in 2016 by beating RCB in the final. He contributed handsomely in the final, with
                                a 38-ball 69, and ended the tournament as the second-highest run-scorer (848). His side
                                failed to make the final in 2017, but he won himself his second Orange cap (641 runs at
                                58.27). However, he was banned by the BCCI from playing the 2018 IPL season after
                                ball-tampering allegations in the Newlands Test. He has been cleared to return for the
                                2019 season, but has been barred from a leadership role. However, as a batsman, he
                                continues to remain a vital cog in the SRH top order and a phenomenal 2019 season where
                                he got the Orange Cap, once again proved the point. <br><br> <b>World Cup through the
                                    years</b> <br> The 2019 edition will be Warner’s second World Cup, having been a
                                part of the 2015 tournament at home which was won by the Aussies. He didn’t have a great
                                tournament by his standards, his statistics boosted largely due to the daddy hundred
                                that he got against Afghanistan. Still, he often got the team off to a flier and that
                                helped Australia get early impetus in their innings. Four years later, Warner is a more
                                matured man by on-field and off-field experiences. While he continues to be a nightmare
                                for bowlers, what’s more ominous is his newly found ability to bat long and deep into an
                                innings. Needless to say, he will be a key man for Australia in the 2019 World Cup.
