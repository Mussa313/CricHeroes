                        <div class="list-content"><span style="color:#333">Shikhar Dhawan shot to fame after an
                                unprecedented run in the 2004 U-19 World Cup, where he scored 505 runs garnished with 3
                                hundreds. However, it took him a long while to make it to the Indian team due to the
                                large amount of competition at the time. A naturally attacking left-handed opener,
                                Dhawan has been one of the mainstays of the Delhi line-up for a long time and forms an
                                impregnable top-order along with Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag, scoring runs by the
                                barrel along with them. He was rated quite highly by experts for his ability to dig in
                                and play the big innings. <br><br> Dhawan, with his side-on stance and negligible
                                trigger movement, is strong on the off-side with his cuts and drives. However, his
                                leg-side game tends to be scratchy and hurried in stark contrast to his off-side game. A
                                natural stroke-player, Dhawan has the gift of picking the line of the ball early and the
                                length of the ball, allowing him ample time to get into position for any shot that he
                                wishes to play. <br><br>   
                                <br><br> Dhawan has struggled for
                                form in the longer format, with some small chinks in his armour such as the tendency of
                                poking outside off and playing beside the line of the ball at all times rather than over
                                it. Some of the virtues that work for him in the limited form, such as playing close to
                                his body, do not work for him in the longer format because of the parallax error that he
                                undergoes since he doesn't get his eyes over the ball while playing it the moving ball.
                                <br><br> However, Dhawan continued to remain India's go-to man in ODIs and delivered
                                another fine performance in an ICC event, making him a specialist for the biggest stage
                                in the limited-overs format. Despite his limitations, his carefree attitude and his
                                explosive off-side shots, one can't help but draw comparisons with another maverick
                                opener from Delhi. The ability to peak during ICC events makes him an almost
                                indispensable asset to the side in limited -overs cricket - a rather theatrical oddity
                                in his career with the utopian twist of opportune comebacks. <br><br> <b>IPL through the
                                    years</b> <br><br> The Indian Premier League came exactly at the right time in
                                Shikhar Dhawan's cricket career. He wasn't quite the star back then in 2008 but his
                                credentials as a cricketer was good enough to earn him an IPL contract. Dhawan was
                                picked up by Delhi Daredevils and he played in a star-studded team alongside Sehwag,
                                Gambhir, de Villiers, Dilshan, and Collingwood in 2008. Shikhar batted at the vital
                                number-3 spot and ended up as the third highest run-getter with 340 runs in 14 matches.
                                <br><br> In a bizarre decision, Delhi let Shikhar go to Mumbai in the next season. And
                                the move to Mumbai Indians proved to be a disaster for Dhawan. In two seasons for MI,
                                Shikhar only played 15 matches. In 2009, he played 5 matches and averaged 10 and in the
                                next edition, he could only make 191 runs in 10 matches. After two dismal seasons,
                                Dhawan moved to Deccan Chargers and that decision transformed Shikhar's career, he found
                                back his consistency and became one of the key assets for Deccan Chargers first and then
                                for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Soon, he was selected for the Indian team and since then he has
                                been one of the top performers for India as well as for his IPL franchise. <br><br>
                                Ahead of the 2019 IPL auctions, Shikhar was traded by Sunrisers Hyderabad. They sold him
                                to Delhi and in return got Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma, and Shahbaz Nadeem. So, after
                                a gap of 11 years, Shikhar will represent the Delhi franchise again, not Daredevils but
                                Delhi Capitals. <br><br> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br> The Ultimate ICC event
                                player. Shikhar Dhawan is the individual equivalent of the Australian team post the 1999
                                World Cup - regardless of merit or form, he has a knack of attaining his peak form just
                                before World events. Ahead of the 2019 World Cup, things are no different. After a
                                couple of months where he just about managed to hold on to his place in the side, Dhawan
                                was in explosive form during his side's admirable IPL 2019 campaign, ending up as his
                                side's highest run-scorer in the tournament just ahead of the World Cup. In India's 2015
                                World Cup campaign, Dhawan was India's highest run-getter with 412 runs, scoring at an
                                average in excess of 50, with two crucial knocks in pressure games against major teams -
                                137 against South Africa, and a useful 73 against Pakistan. With the 2019 World Cup
                                around the corner, Dhawan, who has consistently performed in ICC events, starting from
                                the Junior World Cup in 2004, until the ICC Champions Trophy in 2017, is bound to be an
                                asset to the Indian team in the 2019 World Cup and possibly a key player in their set-up
                                at the top of the order to lay the foundation for a third title. <br><br> </b></span>
