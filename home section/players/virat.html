                                shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in
                                early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own
                                hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly
                                be an outcast. <br><br> xtended run, he
                                repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase
                                against Sri Lanka in December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases.
                                In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along with his
                                Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an
                                83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting
                                <br><br> <b>That break-through innings…</b> <br> We remember the
                                accolades, but where did it all begin? There's always the one innings that made the
                                world sit up and take notice; the 86-ball knock which he started off as a brash boy, but
                                ended as a man. Chasing an improbable target of 321 off 40 overs to stay alive in the
                                tournament, he laid into the Sri Lankan bowlers and carted his way to 133*, getting
                                India home with more than 2 overs to spare, practically pulling them out of the airport
                                after M.S. Dhoni rather ignorantly remarked that India had already been eliminated from
                                the tournament. <br><br> King Kohli had arrived. The king of the run-chase, and a
                                plethora of ODI records in the modern age. <br><br> <b>Batting technique and
                                    idiosyncrasies</b> <br> Kohli has a seemingly hot head on his shoulders, but he
                                channels all his anger while he is batting. Known to be an aggressive batsman always on
                                the lookout for runs, he has a fairly sound , albeit slightly unconventional technique,
                                which makes him judge the length of the ball earlier than most, and amazingly quick
                                wrists to run his hands through the ball, even against fast bowlers. He is equally adept
                                against pace and spin, and never looks ungainly at the crease. With nimble foot-movement
                                against the spinners, he is known to be quite destructive when the situation demands it.
                                He has had to fill some rather big shoes of his predecessors, and has done an admirable
                                job to say the least. <br><br> <b>Technical Shortcomings </b> <br> However, his slightly
                                unconventional bottom-hand technique results in some technical shortcomings and lack of
                                versatility. Kohli has dealt with swing bowling well, which is late and difficult to
                                pick, but still less abrupt than seam bowling, which is almost unnatural and catches you
                                off-guard. He is, without a doubt, one of the most gifted cricketers who has also worked
                                very hard on his game and fitness. As a result, he picks the length early and has a
                                swift and decisive backward or forward movement. However, he picks up the line early
                                too, and as a result, reacts to it equally early. This is quite amazing in itself;
                                however, on pitches lacking true bounce and aiding seam movement, it brings about his
                                downfall. Virat tends to 'run his hands through the ball' beside him rather than
                                punching it late under his line of vision (a virtue that his compatriot Ajinkya Rahane
                                excels at). <br><br>  
                                <b>Captaincy and a change in technique</b> <br> With regular captain MS Dhoni ailing
                                from an injury, Kohli was named stand-in captain for the first Test at Adelaide. After
                                an abysmal tour of England, critics were sceptical of Kohli's performance in Australia
                                in the Border-Gavaskar trophy in December. Kohli proved that they couldn't have been
                                more wrong, as he scored two fluent hundreds in the first Test at Adelaide. His second
                                innings masterclass of 141 almost pulled off a stunning run-chase on a notorious 5th day
                                rank-turner, and went on to score a total of four hundreds on this tour. Saying that he
                                had silenced critics would be an understatement; however, his technique of playing
                                beside the ball, and the bat coming down from gully rather than slip continued to bother
                                him whenever exposed to late lateral movement. <br><br> As India prepared for their
                                title defence ahead of the 2015 World Cup Down Under, with the catch phrase 'Won't give
                                it back' doing the rounds, Virat Kohli was touted to be a key performer for India. The
                                Indians had a terrible run in Australia, having failed to win a single match in the Test
                                series as well as the succeeding ODI tri-series. Kohli started off in signature fashion,
                                with a typically stroke-filled hundred against Pakistan as India maintained their
                                unbeaten run against their arch-rivals in ICC events. As India stormed into the
                                semi-finals unbeaten, Kohli's form continued to take an uncharacteristic dip,
                                culminating in a painstaking 1 in the semi-final loss against the co-hosts and eventual
                                champions, Australia. <br><br> Kohli, now the full-time Test captain, toured Sri Lanka
                                with a young side without the services of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wary of the Sri Lankan
                                spinners' fabled 4th innings con-job. After losing the first Test, Kohli's India
                                recorded a dramatic come-from-behind win in the series, going on to win 2-1. Kohli
                                continued to build on his auspicious start to Test captaincy as he led them to a rout of
                                the South Africans on a series of rank-turners all around India. He had a quiet series
                                with the bat, as the more stoic batsmen of his team took over. Nonetheless, the triumph
                                took India to the No. 1 spot in the ICC Test rankings for the first time since they
                                forfeited it to England after the forgettable white-wash in 2011. <br><br> <b>IPL and
                                    T20 dominance</b> <br> He continued his emphatic run in the T20 WC, batting (and
                                running) like a man possessed, thrashing boundaries with ridiculous ease. Despite an 89*
                                in the semi-final against the West Indies (extending his inhuman run of form in the
                                format), India's bowling panicked at a crucial stage. One had to feel sorry for him as
                                he had to make do with the 'Player of the tournament' award for the second successive
                                T20 WC; a distinction he would've gladly exchanged for the elusive T20 WC trophy.
                                Kohli's thirst for runs showed no signs of slowing down as he looted a small matter of
                                973 runs during the 2016 edition of the Indian Premier League, the most (by far) by any
                                batsman in the history of the tournament - as he led his Royal Challengers Bangalore
                                (RCB) franchise to a runners-up finish.      <br><br> <b>IPL through the
                                    years</b> <br><br> Ahead of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL),
                                Virat Kohli showed how much faith he had in the franchise by declaring that he would
                                perhaps end his career with the Bangalore-based Royal Challengers. The only player to be
                                a part of a single franchise for the entire duration of the tournament (right from the
                                start of the cash-rich league in 2008), Kohli has developed an affection with the
                                franchise and with the fans over the period of time. <br><br> Having been brought into
                                the franchise as a young emerging player in 2008, Kohli's growth has been stupendous. He
                                learnt under the wings of Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, before finally establishing
                                himself under Daniel Vettori. It wasn't a free-flowing start, in a team that was
                                struggling to find the essence of the tournament, it wasn't a surprise that they had a
                                struggling youngster in the midst. Having learnt the ropes in the first three-year
                                cycle, it wasn't a surprise that he was the only player retained in 2011. The purple
                                patch began somewhere around that region, he then proved it wasn't just a purple patch,
                                it was a career that was beginning to flourish. Soon after, Kohli became the best in all
                                aspects, not just white-ball cricket, but in the red-ball version as well. <br><br> It
                                became a no-brainer when he was asked to captain the Bangalore franchise on a permanent
                                basis from 2012 and it also translated into more consistency with the bat. Kohli soon
                                turned into a fan favourite even as runs flowed from his bat. Circa, 2016 - the India
                                and RCB captain blasted 973 runs - the most by any player in the history of the game and
                                it included four hundreds - the most by a batsman in a single edition. Alas, all this
                                didn't translate into a title triumph - one that has kept Kohli and Bangalore waiting
                                <br><br> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br> Arguably one of the finest ODI batsmen
                                of all-time, and certainly the greatest of his generation, Virat Kohli has played two
                                senior World Cups after leading the junior team to the title in 2008. In 2011, on his
                                World Cup debut, Kohli played second fiddle to Virender Sehwag on his way to a fluent
                                hundred against Bangladesh. After a great innings to start with, Kohli had a quiet World
                                Cup before scoring an important 35 in the final to rescue the chase with Gambhir and lay
                                the foundation for a second World Cup triumph. In the 2015 edition, Kohli was fully
                                primed as India's best limited-overs batsman with several solid performances under his
                                belt and started off in fine fashion with a stable hundred against Pakistan. After a 46
                                against South Africa, his form took a dip during the latter stages of the World Cup
                                before culminating in a 13-ball 1 as India crashed out of the World Cup in the
                                semi-final. His ODI average in the 2017/18 ODI season has been a Bradmanesque 97.5, and
                                he has amassed an unreal 19 hundreds since the 2015 World Cup. After the low of the
                                World Cup ouster in 2015, Kohli leads the Indian side this time, with perhaps the
                                strongest ODI team in the world, and as this generation's greatest ODI batsman. <br><br>
