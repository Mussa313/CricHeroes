                        <div class="list-content"><span style="color:#333">Talent – an apparently heartening term that
                                has followed Rohit Sharma around like a shadow; even haunted him at times. It seems to
                                be a burden that the cricketing fraternity has enforced upon him and, after more than a
                                decade in the national setting, he has been weighed down by the label. <br><br>   It all began after
                                an injury to an in-form Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 T20 WC, when Rohit was called upon as a
                                last-minute emergency replacement to play a league game against the hosts. After a
                                lacklustre start to the Indian innings, the 20-year-old strode out into Kingsmead and
                                stroked his way to a fluent half-century against the likes of Pollock, Ntini and Morkel
                                as though he were having a net session. He showed startling maturity under pressure to
                                survive till the end of the innings, escorting India to a respectable total that they
                                ultimately defended, knocking South Africa out of the tournament in their own backyard.
                                <br><br>        Rohit's proved himself on the IPL stage again in 2011 and made
                                a comeback ODI squad for the tour of West Indies where he scored three half-centuries in
                                five matches. However, this turned out to be another false dawn as he followed it up
                                with a string of low scores in the CB series in Australia and a nightmare tour of Sri
                                Lanka with 14 runs in 5 innings, including 2 ducks. He had already been given a
                                more-than-extended run and was starting to build an unenviable reputation of a
                                frustratingly fascinating player. <br><br> The generally fickle selectors, surprisingly,
                                continued to back him. Eventually, due to lack of contenders for the opener's spot in
                                ODIs, MS Dhoni, the Indian captain, decided to try him as an opener in the
                                limited-overs' format. <br><br>   
                                After an injury-break, Rohit, as if to make up for lost time, ripped apart a hapless Sri
                                Lankan attack on his way to a jaw-dropping 264 – wait for it – <i>in an ODI</i> at the
                                Eden Gardens, making thirteen runs more than the entire Lankan team managed. <br><br>
                                 Rohit,
                                the ODI player, finally delivered a break-through performance as an opener with an
                                impeccable limited-overs tour of Australia in early 2016, making back-to-back hundreds
                                and a 99 in the series and finally answering the faith of the selectors and his captain.
                                He had become a one-day monster who developed a habit started his ODI innings in a slow
                                and steady manner, but could really lay into any bowling attack once he was in. With an
                                extended home season, Rohit continued to get chances in Tests and showed vast
                                improvement in his technique, playing closer to his body and preventing his ODI game to
                                amalgamate with his more air-tight Test technique. With four fifties and a hundred in
                                his last 5 innings, he capped off a fruitful home season with an unprecedented third ODI
                                double-century against a woebegone Sri Lankan attack. <br><br> Eerily enough, Rohit has
                                once again been picked for the Test series in South Africa based on his performances at
                                home. With the vexatious pattern of getting picked for away tours based on home
                                performances, and no county stints in his CV, Rohit would be looking forward to
                                correcting the glaring blemish in his record – Test performances outside the
                                subcontinent. <br><br>  
                                <i>what could have been</i>. <br><br> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br><br> The IPL has
                                done a lot for Rohit Sharma. When he was a young, talented batsman who struggled with
                                consistency, the IPL gave him a ticket to stay relevant, and he grabbed it with both
                                hands during his time with the Deccan Chargers from 2008-2010, scoring over 350 runs in
                                each of the three seasons. Then the IPL took him back to his home of Mumbai, and Rohit
                                couldn't have been happier. His statistics with the Mumbai Indians got progressively
                                better from 2011-13, and eventually his best IPL season in 2013 - where he finished the
                                tournament with 538 runs - coincided with MI's maiden title win. <br><br> And finally,
                                the IPL helped unveil a leadership side to Rohit Sharma that has impressed a lot of
                                people. In six years as captain, Rohit has led MI to three IPL titles which is an
                                amazing accomplishment. Rohit is among the all-time top run-scorers in the IPL, only
                                behind Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli. He is the most successful IPL captain, along with
                                MS Dhoni, with three titles. And he has 34 IPL fifties, just two behind the top-most
                                number held by David Warner and Gautam Gambhir. <br><br> <b>World Cup through the
                                    years</b> <br> India's right-handed opener, one who established himself a little
                                late his career at the top of the order, has become a vital cog in India's limited-overs
                                set-up, particularly after his spectacular performances in Australia in the
                                limited-overs series in early 2016. The only man to score three double-hundreds in ODIs
                                was a plaudit that exhibited remarkable talent, but not consistency. Sharma, however,
                                has changed that in the last few years, at least in the white-ball game, and goes into
                                the 2019 World Cup as the World's second-ranked batsman after his captain. His record in
                                the one World Cup he has been a part of - 2015 - has been excellent, with 330 runs in 8
                                innings, including 2 fifties and a hundred, at an average of 47.14. Even between the
                                2015 edition and the 2019 edition, Sharma has evolved as a batsman and will certainly
                                play a major role if India are to compete for the cricket world's most coveted trophy.
